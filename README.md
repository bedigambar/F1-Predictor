## 🎯 Features

- **Qualifying Position Prediction**: Predict grid positions based on practice performance and driver form
- **Race Result Prediction**: Forecast final race positions using qualifying results and weather conditions
- **Safety Car Probability**: Calculate the likelihood of safety car deployment
- **Grid Comparison Mode**: Compare multiple drivers side-by-side
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Position progression charts and feature importance analysis
- **Historical Statistics**: Circuit-specific data and trends

## 🚫 Deployment Note

This application is **not currently deployed** on Streamlit Cloud due to resource limitations with the heavy ML dependencies (XGBoost, FastF1, scikit-learn) and large model files. 

**To run the app**, please follow the local installation instructions below. The setup is straightforward and takes only a few minutes!

## 📦 Installation

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/f1-predictor.git
cd f1-predictor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

### Data Collection & Model Training (Optional)

If you want to retrain the models with fresh data:

```bash
# Fetch F1 data
python scripts/fetch_data.py

# Preprocess data
python scripts/preprocess.py

# Train models
python src/train.py
```

## 🎨 Dashboard Preview

The dashboard features:
- **Premium F1-themed UI** with custom CSS styling
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes
- **Real-time predictions** with interactive controls
- **Data-driven insights** with historical statistics

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These predictions are generated by AI models trained on limited historical data (2022-2024 seasons). Real-world F1 racing involves many unpredictable variables (crashes, mechanical failures, strategy errors) that cannot be fully accounted for. Treat these results as estimates rather than certainties.
